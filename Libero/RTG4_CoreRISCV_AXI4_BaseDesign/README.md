# RTG4 CoreRISCV_AXI4 Base Design

### Overview
This Libero SoC design implements a simple RISC-V microcontroller design for a Microsemi RTG4 Rad-Tolerant FPGA. It includes a UART, GPIOs, timers and SPI flash. The RISC-V code executes from one of the DDR memory controller.

### DIP switches
DIP switch 1 controls the system's boot sequence. When in the ON position, the application executable is copied from SPI flash into DDR memory by the CoreBootStrap IP block. DIP swicth 1 in the OFF position leaves the DDR memory content unmodified at boot up. Please put DIP switch 1 in the OFF position when actively debugging software in order to avoid CoreBootStrap interfering with the executable downloaded by the debugger.

### Programming the SPI flash content
A simple bare metal bootloader is available from the SoftConsole example workspace available from the [SoftConsole GitHub page](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole). This bootloader can be executed on the board using the SoftConsole debugger to transfer a binary from the host PC using the YModem file transfer protocol and writing this binary into the SPI flash.


### IP packages
This design includes a number of IP packages that are not available by default from the Libero catalog. These packages are availalble from the [riscv-junk-drawer](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/riscv-junk-drawer/tree/master/IP-packages).
