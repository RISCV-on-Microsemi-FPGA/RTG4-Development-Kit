# Libero Projects
The Libero_Projects folder contains sample Mi-V Libero designs for Libero v12.6. Libero projects for older Libero releases can be downloaded from their [tags](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/Future-Avalanche-Board/releases) in this repository.

## Design Features
The Libero designs include the following features:
* A soft RISC-V [processor](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/CPUs)
* A RISC-V debug block allowing on-target debug using SoftConsole
* The operating frequency of the design is 50MHz
* Target memory is SRAM (32kB)
* User peripherals: 2 Timers, UART, 2 GPIO Inputs and 4 GPIO Outputs (GPIOs use fixed configs for simplicity and better resource utilization)

## Target Hardware
Details of the RTG4 Development kit and it's features can be found:

# FlashPro Express
The FlashPro_Express_Projects folder contains the pre-generated programming files, which can be downloaded directly to the target board using FlashPro Express.

# Design Tools
The following design tools are required.

## Libero SoC v12.6
[Libero SoC](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/libero-soc#downloads) is Microchip's FPGA design software.

## FlashPro Express
[FlashPro Express](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software) is Microchip's Programming and debug tool. It is included in the Libero SoC software and is also
available as a standalone application. Please note, that if Libero SoC is already on your system, you do not need
the standalone version.

## SoftConsole
[SoftConsole](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4879-softconsole) is Microchipâ€™s free software development environment facilitating the rapid development of bare-metal and RTOS based C/C++ software for Microchip CPU and SoC based FPGAs. It provides development and debug support for all Microchip SoC FPGAs and 32-bit soft IP CPUs. SoftConsole can be downloaded.
